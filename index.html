  // Q: Find the count of every word in a string in a sequence manner ?

  // step 1. we will create an empty string for showing the result.
  // step 2. after that we will ittrate a loop on given string.
  // step 3. make a condition if the character is equal to the next character so increase the count of that character.
  // step 4. and at one time, character is not equal to the next character so assign that character with their count in empty string.
  // step 5. if it is not equal frst tym so assign that character in string nd initialise by 1.

  const str = "AAAABBBCCDAABB";
  let result = "";
  let count = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === str[i + 1]) {
      count++;
    } else {
      result += str[i] + count;
      count = 1;
    }

    // With Ternary Operator :
    //                  str[i] === str[i + 1] ? count++ : ((result += str[i] + count), (count = 1));
  }
  console.log("result :", result);
